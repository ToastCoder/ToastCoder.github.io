Hi, I'm Vignesh.I'm a Computer Geek and a self-motivated ECE student having great interest towards Computer Science and its associated hardware and software fields. I'm having a long and a profound passion towards the tech industry and wish to learn more about it. I wish to make myself nearly up to date with the release of new products in the tech industry such as Smartphones, Laptops, Cars, Smart Gadgets etc and their internal hardware and software. Also, I wish to make revolutions in current technologies and help the society to improve its way of living. Interested in AI/ML/DL and Cloud Computing based jobs.

What's so special about me?
============================

I'm a guy who often wishes to learn something new and push my limits everyday. Unlike most of the people who are passionate on their career after joining College. I was fascinated by computers and its associated fields. I first used a computer during my Class 1 and right from that day, I have been fascinated by deep tech involved in it. No matter whatever the field in computer science, I'm really curious to know about it.
